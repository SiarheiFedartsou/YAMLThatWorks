[![Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/YAMLThatWorks.svg?style=flat)](http://cocoapods.org/pods/YAMLThatWorks)

## Usage

Usage is very similar to ```NSJSONSerialization```:
```objectivec
id object = [YATWSerialization YAMLObjectWithData:data options:0 error:nil]
```
Currently we have only one option:
* ```YATWSerializationOptionsScalarDisableAutomaticConversion``` - disables automatic conversions of scalars to NSNumber if possible, but supported tags(!!bool, !!float etc) will still work.

## Requirements

## Installation

YAMLThatWorks is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "YAMLThatWorks"
```
